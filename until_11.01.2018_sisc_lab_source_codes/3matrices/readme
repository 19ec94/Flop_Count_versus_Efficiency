Program : 3 matrices multiplication 
files   : main.c
          multi.c

For ease of compilation a makefile is provided. The given program uses OpenBLAS libraray. 
Before executing the makefile make sure to link the OpenBLAS library path in your system.
For example-see makefile- (in my case) 
gcc -o output main.o multi.o -I /opt/OpenBLAS/include/ -L/opt/OpenBLAS/lib -lopenblas -lpthread -lgfortran   

make sure to provide your system path
gcc -o output main.o multi.o -I /<your system path>/OpenBLAS/include/ -L/<your system path>/OpenBLAS/lib -lopenblas -lpthread -lgfortran
 

if it is done, then run the follwing commands

1) make
2) ./output arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4   

you should see some output on your screen at this point :).
